### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Data Engineer and Data Scientist with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Data Science and a strong background in Electronic Engineering.

ðŸ”¹ Developing machine learning and predictive models (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
ðŸ”¹ Creating interactive dashboards (Streamlit, Power BI).
ðŸ”¹ Automating analytics workflows â€” reducing processing time by up to 90%.
